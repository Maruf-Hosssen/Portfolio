This is my personal portfolio website. This is made by next.js. In backend I used express.js and mongodb. This is a full stack portfolio website. 
Here I used a different admin dashboard from where I can dynamically update data. WHen I complete a new project I can add that to my portfolio from dashboard. Also I implement a blog editing system.
